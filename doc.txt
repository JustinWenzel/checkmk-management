Dependency Injection (DI)
Objects receive their dependencies from outside rather than creating them with new.

Inversion of Control (IoC)
The framework controls object creation and lifecycle, not your code. DI is the main implementation of IoC.

Bean
An object managed by the Spring IoC Container. Defined via @Component, @Service, or @Bean methods.


@Configuration
Marks a class as a source for bean definitions. Typically contains @Bean methods that create objects and add them to the Spring context.

@Component
Generic annotation that registers the class itself as a bean. Spring automatically creates an instance. Specializations: @Service, @Repository, @Controller.

@Data (Lombok)
Automatically generates getters, setters, toString(), equals(), hashCode(), and a constructor for all final fields. Shorthand for @Getter @Setter @ToString @EqualsAndHashCode @RequiredArgsConstructor.

@RequiredArgsConstructor (Lombok)
Generates a constructor for all final fields and fields marked with @NonNull

@LazyCollection controls whether related data is fetched from the database immediately or only when you actually need it.

FetchType controls when related data is loaded from the database.
